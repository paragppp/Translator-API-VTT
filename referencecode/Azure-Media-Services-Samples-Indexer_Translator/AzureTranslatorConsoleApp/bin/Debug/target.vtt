00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.630
Yes

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:25.100
Good morning, and records 2016 Welcome to join us and I will serve as a host for everyone, so I was in a code event this time. This keynote is in Japanese and in English at this very moment.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:45.660
We have been streaming live all over the world so we have the first greetings in English and now Japan Microsoft as a third this is a record event, but it has grown every year to symbolize the transformation of Microsoft itself, and this year, it's a team.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:01:06.430
This is the global level of content. Global level of speaker and glow it's a passion technology that we're going to send you now. I hope you'll enjoy it.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.140
So I would like you to come to my excellent personal assistant.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.750
Mr. Cortana.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.570
Hello, welcome.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.240
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.960
What's the first thing about Cortana today

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:56.080
How about a guide book? Well, that's the first thing I'd like to start with in a guidebook this is the Prince Park Tokyo Tower here, but there is a Tokyo tower in the vicinity. This is a guidebook, but a guidebook.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:16.280
The test will be two-dimensional information, so what information is hidden here? Let's take a look at this camera app. Camera on this tablet now launching the app you're moving in like this. I'll try to image the catalog here as sterilization in a fine camera app

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:37.430
Do you know your whole life? The three D models of Tokyo Tower came out like this, and I can see the life expectancy of the flag, and it is possible to look at the top of the tower.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:50.590
Unusual game you can, for example, when you turn this catalog, you can see the back of Tokyo Tower. This is an app.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:10.000
It has been developed using a tool set that is carved on top of unity this is a WP app, but it has pen support so it is also possible to write with a pen in Tokyo Tower, so let's write Tokyo tower with great pains

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.450
Now what?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:34.340
Yes, this is the way Tokyo Tower's annotations can be said to be incorporated into this electronically in this way. Augmented reality if the world comes to be able to make it easily, it is also in the way that the usage increases in various business scenes. New Business

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:45.570
The first thing you'll need is a business card here, and for some reason I have a business card in my mind, so I want to do a little bit about what this business card can look like.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.840
Yes

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:08.390
It's a shame, but it seems to be the person of this business card, but I'm going to ask you a question. Hey Akira Sakaki If you have a tag, it's like Mr. Sakakibara.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.240
Hey Cortana, let me ask you something.
